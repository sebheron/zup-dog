*zup-dog* is a 3D editor utilising ZDog as its engine and built in React.

### Why?

I'm a big fan of spline and its inteface for building 3d scenes is brilliant. This is my butchering attempt at recreating it for a more lightweight engine, with its own visual appeal.

### Build manually

After cloning the repo run `npm run dev` to start the dev server and `npm run build` to build the application.
