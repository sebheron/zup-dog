*zup-dog* is a 3D editor utilising ZDog as its engine and built in React.

### Why?

I'm a big fan of spline and its interface for building 3d scenes is brilliant. This is my butchering attempt at recreating it for a more lightweight engine, with its own visual appeal.

### What's done?
- All built in zdog shapes are supported.
- Shape transform and rotation gizmos.
- Property editor is 90% done.

### What's todo?
- Spline style path editor for shapes.
- Undo/redo.
- Clean up property editor.

### Building and running

After cloning the repo run `npm run dev` to start the dev server and `npm run build` to build the application.
