### Why?

I'm a big fan of spline and its interface for building 3d scenes is brilliant. ZDog is a really cool engine for building 3d scenes lacking a powerful visual editor, so inspired by spline I decided to build one.

### Features

- [x] All built in zdog shapes are supported.
- [x] Shape transform, rotation and scaling gizmos.
- [x] Property editor.
- [x] Export/Import JSON.
- [x] Export as script.
- [ ] Spline style path editor for shapes.
- [ ] Undo/redo.

### Known issues
- 🪲 Groups don't render their children until a child is removed from the group.
- 🪲 Sometimes the gizmos fail to update their rotation.
- 🪲 Non-uniform scaling causes issues due to underlying math. See [zdog known issues](https://zzz.dog/extras#known-bugs-hemisphere-cylinder-cone-scale-bug) for more info.

### Building and running

After cloning the repo run `npm run dev` to start the dev server and `npm run build` to build the application.
